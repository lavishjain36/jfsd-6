Polymorphism:
Method overloading & Overriding
Abstraction:
Hide internal implementation and highlighting the set of services is abstraction.
By using abstract class(0-100%) and interface(100%) , we can implement abstraction in java.


keyword->abstract keyword in java.
abstract classname

abstract Mobilephone{
m1();
m2();
m3();
}

1.abstract class before class
2.abstract method 
3.you can not create an object class.
4.child class of abstract class->implementation.



interface->to provide pure abstraction.





ATM machine?
bank people-
Abstract classes->partial implementation
interface-100& pure 
Encapsulation:getter and setter
Packages
Access modifiers


Tea->taking container+add water+milk+adding tea leaves+ingriendents.=>end product->Tea

Magesh:
take a bowl+add water+boil water+tea leaves+
externally->milk=>Tea
Person->Lavish
I ->Mentor
Friends-
Family->
Employee
Child
Husband
1.Method Overloading->Compiler time polymorphism
class->single
if a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameter,also the number parameter may also differ->Method overloading


class->calculator-
add(int num1,int num2);
add(int num1,int num2,int num3);
add(float num1,float num2)

2.Method Overriding->Run time polymorphism
min-atleast 2 class->inherited.

if a child class has the same method as declared in parent class->overriding.

Polymorphism->
Overloading and oveririding
Method overloading
Method overriding


Constructor overloading
Constructor oveririding

operator overloading->+





loop->
reference obj
prod1obj=>person-1=>101,500,

prod2obj=>person-2=>102,700,

iterate through loop and get price of the all product.




Assume current->0
take input from user with some details:
Customer name
account
Money:0

deposit->
an option->Scanner to enter money float->
1000Rs

totalamount=money+deposit



withdraw->
scanner->300
Remaing=totalamount-withdraw
