List(I)->ArrayList,LinkedList.
Queue(I)->Priority,ArrayDequeue
Set(I)->TreeSet,HashSet,LinkedHashSet

Collection->import java.util.*;->import everythings

In Collection->Every data stores as an object data.

1.ArrayList(C)->
inbuilt class->Collection API(Application programming interface).
Store data in memory ->ArrayList->List interface(import list interface).

Insertion ,deleteion
Duplicate ->10,20,10,20
Size of array list growable based on data.
add()->method


2.LinkedList(C)->

Node->1.data 2.address to next node.
Linked list which can store homogenous and hetregenous data like 
it stores in datatstructure

When we want to add the data ->No shifting takes places->
add new node and link with previous node.

addFirst();->adding element in first
addLast();->adding element to last




4 patient->

2.Patient->Minor injury
1.Patiend->moderate.
3.Patient->Critical


Queue->
Simple ex:
SET->to store group of element  which are unique element



Set->
a group of unique values.
index is not possible in set



Key-value-

Key-
101->index->in hash table->Lavish
102->index->Lavish/Dhanush
Collection framework->

Array and Collection Framework

Limitation:
store the data using array, its difficult to store large amount of data.
Array->index based->performing operation on array is costly operation
Homogenous data->can't store heterogenours
size of fixed.
inbuilt methods->to perform an operation
large volume of data->Array



Collection API->Joshua->
1.2-version
Collection API,Hierarchy and Framework

Collection framework in Java ->provides an architecture  to store and manipulate the group of objects.
Collection Framwork->Interface and group of classes with their methods.->

Data structure and algorith=inbuilt data structure
C++->STL
Python->List, Tuple,set ,dicitionary
Java->Collection Interface





ArrayList->array/

convert the arrayList to array?


































Garbage Collection
File Handling in java
